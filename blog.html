<p><em>Date: July 28, 2023</em></p>

<p>Hey there, fellow curious minds and fellow pet lovers! We're Alex and Taylor, a couple living just outside of Washington, D.C., and we've got a unique obsession that might raise a few eyebrows – congressional apportionment.</p>

<p>Now, before you start scratching your heads and wondering what's so captivating about congressional apportionment, let us introduce you to our dynamic duo – Scipio and Nero, our two adorable pets. Scipio, the wise and contemplative cat, and Nero, the energetic and inquisitive dog, have unwittingly become our partners in this fascinating journey.</p>


<p>It all started a couple of years ago when we found ourselves engrossed in a documentary about the United States Congress. As the TV screen lit up with discussions on representation, districts, and allocations, we realized that this seemingly complex system held an incredible amount of influence over our daily lives. We were intrigued by the math behind congressional apportionment and how it shapes the political landscape of our nation.</p>


<p>With Scipio curled up on the couch and Nero wagging his tail, we dug deeper into the numerical intricacies that govern the allocation of House seats. We found ourselves engrossed in conversations about the Census Bureau, methods like the Huntington-Hill formula, and the historical significance of maintaining fair representation.</p>

<p>We soon realized that Scipio, with his calm demeanor, perfectly embodied the precision and calculated nature of apportionment. On the other hand, Nero, always on the move and exploring new things, became our metaphor for the ever-changing population dynamics that drive the need for consistent reapportionment.</p>


<p>We decided to embrace our newfound passion wholeheartedly. Our weekends transformed into mini-apportionment seminars, with Scipio and Nero as our patient (or perhaps just curious) audience. We mapped out scenarios, debated about the most appropriate methods, and even used treats to simulate seat allocations – a game that Nero enthusiastically endorsed.</p>


<p>Our friends and family might raise an eyebrow or two when we bring up our favorite topic at gatherings, but we've come to embrace our unique obsession. We've realized that understanding congressional apportionment isn't just about numbers; it's about understanding the essence of democracy and representation.</p>

<p>So, here we are, a couple with two pets, Scipio and Nero, living outside D.C., unapologetically obsessed with congressional apportionment. As we write this blog post, Nero is playfully chasing his tail, and Scipio is giving us that knowing cat look, reminding us that just like the delicate balance of representation, there's a method to our madness.</p>

<p>Thanks for joining us on this journey, and if you ever find yourself engrossed in a conversation about congressional seats with two enthusiastic pets by your side, remember that you're not alone!</p>

<p><em>Stay curious,</em><br>

<h1>Apple-Picking Adventures with Scipio and Nero</h1>

<p><em>Date: September 15, 2022</em></p>

<p>Hello, fellow adventurers! It's Alex and Taylor, back with another exciting chapter from our lives just outside of Washington, D.C. This time, our adventure takes us beyond the realm of congressional apportionment and into the crisp orchards of autumn – yes, you guessed it, it's apple-picking season!</p>


<p>As the leaves start to turn golden and the air gains a refreshing chill, we decided to embark on a day of apple-picking. But, of course, we couldn't undertake this adventure alone. Scipio, our thoughtful feline friend, and Nero, our ever-curious canine companion, were more than eager to join us.</p>


<p>We drove to a charming orchard nestled in the countryside, a short distance from our home. Scipio and Nero, with their distinct personalities, seemed equally excited about the change of scenery. Scipio surveyed the surroundings with his characteristic calmness, while Nero's tail wagged energetically as he sniffed the unfamiliar scents.</p>

<p>Equipped with baskets and a sense of anticipation, we set out to explore the rows of apple-laden trees. Scipio gracefully perched himself under a tree, seemingly content to observe the activity around him. Nero, on the other hand, was ready to leap into action – he bounded through the fallen leaves, occasionally stopping to inspect a fallen apple or to greet fellow orchard-goers.</p>

<p>With Scipio watching from his regal vantage point, we carefully picked apples, each one a symbol of the season's abundance. As we filled our baskets, we couldn't help but draw a parallel to the principles of representation we're so intrigued by. Just as each apple contributes to the overall harvest, each voice contributes to the democratic chorus.</p>


<p>Our apple-picking adventure wasn't just about the harvest; it was about the shared moments and the sense of togetherness. As we walked among the trees, discussing the subtle differences between apple varieties, we were reminded of the importance of diverse voices in shaping our society. Whether it's the variety of apples in our baskets or the diversity of ideas in our democracy, it's the mixture that makes things truly special.</p>


<p>With our baskets brimming with apples and our hearts filled with contentment, we bid farewell to the orchard. Back home, as we baked pies and prepared apple-based dishes, we couldn't help but reflect on the lessons of the day. Just like the apportionment methods, apple-picking teaches us about balance, fairness, and reaping the rewards of cooperation.</p>


<p>As we close this chapter of our apple-picking adventure, we invite you to join us on this journey of exploration and discovery. Whether it's the mathematical intricacies of congressional apportionment or the simple joy of apple-picking, every experience enriches our lives and broadens our horizons.</p>

<p><em>With apples and democracy in mind,</em><br>
Alex & Taylor</p>
