      <h2>Bemoaning the Condorcet Paradox</h2>
      <p><b>By Arthur Trismegistus</b></p>

    <div class="poem">
        <p>O Condorcet, you confounding riddle,<br>
        Your paradoxical dance is truly a fiddle.<br>
        With preferences ranked and choices made,<br>
        You weave a conundrum, a baffling charade.</p>

        <p>A candidate loved by many, they say,<br>
        But alas, in this puzzle, may not hold sway.<br>
        As ballots are cast, each with a voice,<br>
        Your paradox emerges, leaving no choice.</p>

        <p>Choice A beats B, and B beats C with might,<br>
        But wait, C prevails against A in the light.<br>
        A cycle of victory, tangled and strange,<br>
        An endless loop where outcomes derange.</p>

        <p>How can it be that a logical quest,<br>
        Unravels into this logical mess?<br>
        The winner's crown is elusive and dim,<br>
        In the heart of this paradox, we're caught within.</p>

        <p>Condorcet, you challenge our voting creed,<br>
        A puzzle of preferences, tangled indeed.<br>
        As we ponder your paradox, minds perplexed,<br>
        Seeking a solution, to you, we're annexed.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Oh, Condorcet Paradox, you vex and you taunt,<br>
    With every rank and choice, a new layer to flaunt.<br>
    We grapple with your enigma, strive to unveil,<br>
    The heart of democratic choice, in your puzzle, we sail.</p>







    <h2>Might, Majority, and Fair Apportionment</h2>
    <p><b>By Garbanzo Le Goumme</b></p>
    <div class="poem">
        <p>In the tapestry of tales, a story unfolds,<br>
        Of might and right, and truths yet untold.<br>
        Arthur's quest, a kingdom to bring,<br>
        As themes entwine in this literary spring.</p>

        <p>Might makes right, a concept debated,<br>
        As swords clash and fates are fated.<br>
        In Camelot's realm, power entwined,<br>
        A question of ethics, a quandary of mind.</p>

        <p>Yet Arthur's wisdom, a beacon of grace,<br>
        Seeks justice's path in a passionate race.<br>
        The power to rule, not solely by might,<br>
        But by heart's intent, and morality's light.</p>

        <p>Enter democracy's realm, majority's voice,<br>
        The principle grand where we all make a choice.<br>
        But beware, as the many decide,<br>
        The minority's plea, can it too subside?</p>

        <p>Apportionment's key, a balance we seek,<br>
        Ensuring fair representation to the unique.<br>
        Each voice matters, as the puzzle unfolds,<br>
        From states large and small, democracy molds.</p>

        <p>For in these tales entwined, threads of thought,<br>
        A narrative woven, with lessons we're taught.<br>
        Might, majority, and fair apportionment unite,<br>
        Shaping our world's future, in the realm of light.</p>
    </div>

    <p>From Arthur's realm to voting's expanse,<br>
    Let fairness and justice guide our advance.<br>
    We ponder these themes, a tapestry's thread,<br>
    As we journey together, where stories are spread.</p>
